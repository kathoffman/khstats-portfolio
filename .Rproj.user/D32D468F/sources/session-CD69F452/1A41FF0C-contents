title: About me
---

My name is Katherine (Kat) Hoffman. I am a research biostatistician based in New York City. I grew up in Michigan and received my M.S. in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan in 2018. Prior to that I earned a B.S. in Biochemistry from the University of Detroit Mercy. My CV is available [[here]]().

I began KH Stats in 2019 with the post [*A Day in the Life of a Biostatistician*](https://www.khstats.com/blog/ditl-biostats/). Since then, I've tried to write about statistics, programming, and career-related topics in ways I think my slightly-younger-self would have found useful. I am especially interested in creating content which helps bridge the communication gap between statistical methodologists, clinician-researchers, and analysts.

When I'm not thinking about my next statistics/programming post, I enjoy reading and being active outdoors.
